#### List WiFi Networks by BSSID only

> [!NOTE]
> + Automatically Sorts by signal strength (stronger first)
> + Groups BSSIDs if `netsh` groups them (usually same SSID or hidden but there can be exceptions)
> + Sort by Signal strength does not apply to Grouped BSSIDs (only the first)
> + Might not list properly unless disconnected (`netsh` behaviour)
