#### List WiFi Networks by BSSID only

> [!NOTE]
> + Automatically Sorts by signal strength (stronger first)
> + Groups BSSIDs if `netsh` groups them (usually same SSID or hidden but there can be exceptions)
> + Grouped BSSIDs are not sorted by signal strength amongst themselves
> + Might not list properly unless disconnected (`netsh` behaviour to note)
