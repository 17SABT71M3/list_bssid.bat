#### List WiFi Networks by BSSID only

> [!NOTE]
> + Automatically Sorts by signal strength (stronger first)
> + Groups BSSIDs together on the same line, according to the `netsh` output (`netsh` usually groups by SSID or hidden networks but there could be exceptions)
> + Sort by Signal strength does not apply to Grouped BSSIDs (only the first)
> + Might not list properly unless disconnected (`netsh` behaviour)
